## Advertised Features vs Reality

### Fully Delivered Features ‚úÖ
1. **Core Time Tracking** - Working timer with all basic features
2. **Multi-Channel Tracking** - PPC, SEO, Social, Email, Content
3. **Client & Project Association** - Link time to clients/projects
4. **Billing Integration** - Stripe subscription management
5. **Basic Reporting** - Time and revenue reports
6. **Dashboard Analytics** - Real-time statistics
7. **Invoice Management** - Create and manage invoices
8. **Authentication** - Secure login system

### Partially Delivered Features ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **AI Insights** - Rule-based + weekly AI report; advanced ML/GenAI not built
2. **Team Collaboration** - Core flows live; broader RBAC and audit logs missing
3. **Import/Export** - Core import/export done; advanced/scheduled emails present; templates/Sheets not built
4. **API Access** - REST + GraphQL available; API keys UI exists but not enforced in middleware
5. **Browser Extension** - Present but requires API wiring and content script

### Missing/Mock Features ‚ùå
1. **Platform Auto-Detection** - Content script absent; no detection rules wired
2. **White-Label Reports** - No branding controls for reports/PDFs
3. **Third-party Integrations** - No Google Ads, Meta, GA4, Slack, etc.
4. **SSO Authentication** - Not implemented
5. **Audit Logs** - Not found
6. **Custom Fields** - Not implemented

---

## Critical Issues

1. **API Keys Not Enforced** - Bearer API key in docs/UI not honored by v1 endpoints (session-only auth)
2. **Browser Extension Wiring** - Uses `/api/*` (not `/api/v1/*`); missing `content.js` for auto-detect
3. **Integration Claims** - Marketing lists several as planned/coming-soon; none implemented yet
4. **White-Label Reporting** - Advertised on features/pricing; no implementation

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Enforce API Key Authentication on v1 endpoints or adjust docs to session-based
2. Fix Browser Extension: add `content.js`, switch to `/api/v1/*`, solidify auth flow
3. Clarify Pro vs Free in UI (locks/badges already present in many places; ensure consistency)
4. White-Label Reporting: minimal theming/branding for exports/PDFs

### Medium Priority
1. Platform Auto-Detection: implement content script URL/title rules with opt-in confirmation
2. Implement initial third-party integrations or narrow claims on marketing site
3. Add audit logging for key actions (team changes, billing events)
4. Broaden RBAC enforcement beyond team API (e.g., project/client scopes)

### Low Priority
1. Enhance AI insights with ML/GenAI
2. Add SSO authentication (Enterprise)
3. Implement custom fields
4. Add capacity planning features

---

## Conclusion

TrackFlow has a **solid foundation** with core time tracking, billing, import/export, API (REST + GraphQL), and invoicing working well. Recent work shipped team collaboration (members, invites, role updates). The main gaps are API key enforcement, browser extension wiring, and several advertised-but-not-yet-built integrations and white-labeling.

Focus next on:
1. API keys enforcement and docs alignment
2. Browser extension auto-detect and API route fixes
3. Minimal white-label for reports/PDFs; integration scope clarity

**Overall Status: ~75% Feature Complete** ‚Äî Core product is strong; advanced/enterprise and integrations need targeted implementation.
