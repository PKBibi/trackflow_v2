3. Clarify Pro vs Free features in UI
4. Complete import functionality

### Medium Priority

2. Add white-label customization for reports
3. Implement missing integrations
4. Add audit logging

## Conclusion

TrackFlow has a **solid foundation** with core time tracking, billing, and basic project management features working well. However, several advertised features are either missing or only partially implemented. The application would benefit from:

1. Completing team collaboration features
2. Delivering on integration promises
3. Better documentation
4. Clearer feature availability communication

**Overall Status: 65% Feature Complete** - Core features work, but advanced/enterprise features need significant development.
