              TrackFlow was born from a simple frustration: tracking time shouldn't be hard.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2024, TrackFlow emerged from the real-world experiences of freelancers 
              and consultants who struggled with existing time tracking solutions. We believed 
              there had to be a better way to track time, manage projects, and get paidâ€”all 
              without the complexity and bloat of enterprise software.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Today, TrackFlow serves thousands of professionals worldwide, from solo freelancers 
              to growing agencies. Our mission remains the same: make time tracking so simple 
              and intuitive that it becomes second nature.
