# TrackFlow Feature Implementation Plan

## ✅ COMPLETED: Team Management System (2025-09-11)

## Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

### 1. ✅ Fix Team Management System - COMPLETED
**Priority: CRITICAL** - Currently using mock data only
- [x] Create Supabase tables:
  - [x] `team_members` table with user_id, role, permissions, invited_by, joined_at
  - [x] `team_invitations` table with email, role, token, expires_at, accepted
- [x] Implement backend API endpoints:
  - [x] GET /api/team/members - List team members
  - [x] POST /api/team/invite - Send invitation
  - [x] POST /api/team/accept - Accept invitation
  - [x] PUT /api/team/members/[id] - Update member role
  - [x] DELETE /api/team/members/[id] - Remove member
- [x] Connect UI to real data:
  - [x] Replace mock data in settings/team/page.tsx
  - [x] Add invitation email sending via Resend (partial - needs API key)
  - [x] Implement role-based access control
- [x] Add team member limits based on plan (3 for Free, 10 for Pro, unlimited for Enterprise)

### 2. ✅ Complete Import Functionality - COMPLETED
**Priority: HIGH** - UI exists but not wired up
- [x] Implement CSV/Excel parsing logic:
  - [x] Parse uploaded files using existing XLSX library
  - [x] Map columns to database fields
  - [x] Validate data before import
- [x] Create import API endpoint:
  - [x] POST /api/import/time-entries
  - [x] POST /api/import/clients
  - [x] Add batch insert with transaction support
- [x] Add progress tracking and error handling
- [x] Show import results summary

### 3. ✅ Create API Documentation - COMPLETED
**Priority: HIGH** - Easy fix for broken links
- [x] Create /app/(marketing)/docs/api/page.tsx
- [x] Document existing endpoints:
  - [x] REST API (v1/time-entries, v1/clients, v1/projects)
  - [x] GraphQL endpoint
  - [x] Authentication requirements
- [x] Add code examples for common operations
- [x] Include rate limiting information

## Medium Effort Features (1-2 days each)

### 4. Complete Client/Project Management UI
- [ ] Add create client modal/page
- [ ] Add edit client functionality
- [ ] Add create project modal/page
- [ ] Add edit project functionality
- [ ] Implement archiving instead of hard delete

### 5. Implement Retainer Alerts
- [ ] Add retainer_limit and alert_thresholds to clients table
- [ ] Create background job to check retainer usage
- [ ] Send email alerts at 75%, 90%, 100%
- [ ] Add in-app notifications
- [ ] Show retainer burndown in client view

### 6. Enhanced Export Features
- [ ] Add PDF export using React PDF or similar
- [ ] Implement Excel export with formatting
- [ ] Add scheduled/recurring exports
- [ ] Create export templates

## Which to Start With?

I recommend starting with:

1. **Team Management** - It's a critical missing feature that's advertised
2. **Import Functionality** - High user value, UI already built
3. **API Documentation** - Quick win that fixes broken links

These can likely all be completed within 2-3 days and would significantly improve the app's completeness.

## Implementation Approach

For each feature:
1. Create database migrations if needed
2. Build API endpoints with proper validation
3. Connect existing UI or build minimal new UI
4. Add error handling and loading states
5. Test with real data
6. Update any related documentation

## Notes
- Keep changes simple and focused
- Use existing patterns from the codebase
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
- Prioritize functionality over perfect UI
