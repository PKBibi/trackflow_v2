# TrackFlow MVP Implementation Plan

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Audit & Analysis
- [x] Audit navigation and links for broken paths
- [x] Check authentication flow and security vulnerabilities
- [x] Review database schema and API endpoints
- [x] Identify missing core functionality
- [x] Create comprehensive audit report

### Critical Fixes Implemented
- [x] Added .env.local to .gitignore (security fix)
- [x] Created demo page (/demo) to fix broken link
- [x] Implemented Supabase authentication in login page
- [x] Implemented Supabase authentication in signup page
- [x] Added middleware for protected route authentication
- [x] Added error handling and loading states to auth forms
- [x] Added form validation to signup (password minimum length)

## ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] Fix timer page functionality (imports and dependencies)

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining MVP Tasks

### High Priority - Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement time tracking persistence (save to database)
- [ ] Create client CRUD operations
- [ ] Create project CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement basic reporting dashboard with real data
- [ ] Add invoice generation functionality
- [ ] Implement user profile management

### Medium Priority - Enhanced Features
- [ ] Add comprehensive form validation (Zod schemas)
- [ ] Implement toast notifications system
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better UX
- [ ] Create data tables for displaying records
- [ ] Add charts/graphs for reports page
- [ ] Implement retainer tracking and alerts

### Low Priority - Polish
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Implement offline support
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create onboarding flow
- [ ] Add export functionality
- [ ] Implement team collaboration features

## ðŸ”’ Security Improvements Made
1. Protected Supabase credentials (added to .gitignore)
2. Implemented authentication middleware
3. Added password validation
4. Protected dashboard routes

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps Priority Order
1. Fix timer page imports and functionality
2. Implement time entry persistence to database
3. Create basic CRUD for clients and projects
4. Connect dashboard to real data
5. Add comprehensive validation using Zod

## ðŸ“Š Review Summary

### What Was Fixed
- **Authentication**: Fully implemented with Supabase including login, signup, and route protection
- **Navigation**: Fixed broken demo link by creating demo page
- **Security**: Protected environment variables and added authentication middleware
- **UX**: Added loading states and error handling to forms

### What Still Needs Work
- **Data Persistence**: No actual data is being saved to database yet
- **Core Features**: Time tracking, client management, invoicing all need implementation
- **Real Data**: Dashboard and other pages show mock data
- **Validation**: Need comprehensive validation schemas

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Added proper error handling
- Implemented loading states
- Created middleware for auth protection
- Fixed broken navigation links

### Estimated Time to MVP
- With current fixes: 3-4 days of focused development
- Priority 1 items: 1-2 days
- Priority 2 items: 1-2 days
- Polish and testing: 1 day
